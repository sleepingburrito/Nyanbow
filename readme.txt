Nyanbow is a 2D platformer made in C++ using SFML. It was the first game I made in C++, It has dash mechanic, double jump, wall jump and shooting (horizontal and vertical). The graphics and code is by me with the help of SFML (like SDL but in C++). My code is licenses under MIT.

Arrow keys move
Up/Down look up and down
Space jumps
A dashes
S shoots (cant see it in the bin since compiling outside of debug hides the debug boxes)
